## Overview
Tea Leaf Disease Detection is a deep learning project that uses the deep learning model model to provide a rapid and accurate solution for identifying five types of tea leaf diseases in real-time. The system was trained on a dataset of 4000 digital images collected from four prominent tea gardens in Bangladesh, with manual annotation and data augmentation to address sample size limitations. Aiming to reduce the time and economic losses associated with manual detection, the project achieves high performance metrics, including 97.3% detection accuracy, 96.7% precision, 96.4% recall, 98.2% mAP value, and 0.965 F1-score, outperforming methods like CNN, Deep CNN, and YOLOv5. This AI-based approach minimizes the workload of entomologists and enhances tea yield quality and productivity.
